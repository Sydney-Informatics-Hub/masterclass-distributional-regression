abstract = {Distributional regression models that overcome the traditional focus on relating the conditional mean of the response to explanatory variables and instead target either the complete conditional response distribution or more general features thereof have seen increasing interest in the past decade. The current state of distributional regression will be discussed, with a particular focus on the four most prominent model classes: (i) generalized additive models for location, scale and shape, (ii) conditional transformation models and distribution regression, (iii) density regression, and (iv) quantile and expectile regression. Characteristics of the different distributional regression approaches will be provided to establish a structured overview on the similarities and differences with respect to the required assumptions on the conditional response distribution, theoretical properties, and the availability of software implementations. In addition, challenges arising in the interpretability of distributional regression models will be discussed and all four approaches will be illustrated with an application analyzing determinants of income distributions from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP).}

 abstract = {Likelihood-based regression models such as the normal linear regression model and the linear logistic model, assume a linear (or some other parametric) form for the covariates X1, X2, ⋯, Xp. We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form ∑ βjXj by a sum of smooth functions ∑ sj(Xj). The sj(·)'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor η = Σ βjXj is replaced by the additive predictor Σ sj(Xj); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.},

@article{heller2022,
	abstract = {The classical linear model is widely used in the analysis of clinical trials with continuous outcomes. However, required model assumptions are frequently not met, resulting in estimates of treatment effect that can be inefficient and biased. In addition, traditional models assess treatment effect only on the mean response, and not on other aspects of the response, such as the variance. Distributional regression modelling overcomes these limitations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate its usefulness for the analysis of clinical trials, and superior performance to that of traditional models.},
